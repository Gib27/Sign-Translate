<h2>What is Sign Language?</h2>
<p>Sign Language is a visual language that is often used by the deaf and hard or hearing community in order to communicate. Sign Language not only utilizes hand signs, but also body language (such as raising eyebrows when asking a question), reading lips, and showing facial expressions.</p>

<h2>American Sign Language</h2>
<p>American Sign Language (ASL) is not a translated English language; it is its own language entirely, with its own dialects and grammar. It doesnâ€™t follow English syntax and grammatical rules. Its dialects include Black American Sign Language (BASL), East Coast Sign, and West Coast Sign. These differ in emotion, movement, and slang.</p>
